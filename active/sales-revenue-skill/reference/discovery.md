# Discovery & Demo Reference

MEDDIC qualification, SPIN questioning, demo execution, and objection handling.

## Discovery Framework

### The Discovery Mindset

```
Discovery is NOT about:          Discovery IS about:
- Pitching your product          - Understanding their world
- Checking boxes                 - Genuine curiosity
- Interrogating                  - Conversational flow
- Assuming pain                  - Letting them articulate pain
```

### Call Flow

| Stage | Goal | Duration | Focus |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Opening | Build rapport, set agenda | 2-3 min | Warm, professional |
| Discovery | Uncover pain, qualify | 15-20 min | Curious, probing |
| Demo | Show relevant value | 15-20 min | Focused, interactive |
| Close | Agree next steps | 5 min | Clear, action-oriented |

## SPIN Questioning Technique

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **S**ituation | Understand context | "Walk me through your current process..." |
| **P**roblem | Surface pain | "What challenges do you face with...?" |
| **I**mplication | Deepen pain | "What happens when that goes wrong?" |
| **N**eed-Payoff | Envision solution | "If you could fix that, what would change?" |

### Question Bank by Category

**Opening / Rapport**
- "Before we dive in, what prompted you to take this call today?"
- "What's the most important thing you want to get out of our time?"
- "I've done some research, but I'd love to hear it from you - what does [Company] do?"

**Current State (Situation)**
- "Walk me through how your team handles [process] today."
- "What tools are you currently using for [function]?"
- "How many people are involved in [workflow]?"
- "What does a typical [day/week/project] look like?"

**Pain Discovery (Problem)**
- "What's working well with your current approach?"
- "Where does the process break down?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would you change?"
- "What's the biggest headache in [area]?"
- "When was the last time [problem] cost you [time/money/deal]?"

**Impact / Implication**
- "What happens when [problem] occurs?"
- "How does that affect [team/revenue/customers]?"
- "What does that cost you in terms of [time/money/opportunity]?"
- "How long has this been an issue?"
- "What have you tried to fix it?"

**Decision Process**
- "Who else is involved in evaluating solutions like this?"
- "What does your decision process typically look like?"
- "What's driving the timeline to make a change?"
- "What would make this a 'no' for you?"
- "Have you looked at other solutions?"

### Deep Dive Questions

**Metrics**
- "What does success look like in numbers?"
- "How are you measuring [current process] today?"

**Economic Buyer**
- "Who ultimately signs off on purchases like this?"

- "What would disqualify a vendor?"

**Decision Process**
- "Walk me through how decisions like this typically get made."
- "What are the steps between now and going live?"
- "Are there any procurement or legal reviews required?"
- "What's a realistic timeline?"

**Identify Pain**
- "What's driving the urgency to solve this now?"

- "Is this a top-3 priority for the team/company?"
- "What's changed that made this a priority?"

**Champion**
- "Who on your team is most excited about solving this?"

## Demo Best Practices

### Demo Structure

```
1. RECAP (2 min)
   "Based on our discovery, you mentioned [pain 1], [pain 2], [pain 3]..."

2. AGENDA (1 min)
   "I'll show you how we address each of those. Stop me anytime."

3. SHOW VALUE (15-20 min)
   Pain 1 -> Feature -> Benefit -> Proof
   Pain 2 -> Feature -> Benefit -> Proof
   Pain 3 -> Feature -> Benefit -> Proof

4. SUMMARIZE (2 min)
   "So to recap, you'd be able to [benefit 1], [benefit 2], [benefit 3]..."

5. NEXT STEPS (5 min)
   "What questions do you have? What's our next step?"
```

### The 3 Rules of Demos

**1. Show, don't tell**
- Bad: "We have great reporting"
- Good: [Open report] "Here's what your Monday morning would look like"

**2. Connect every feature to their pain**
- Bad: "Here's our dashboard with 50 widgets"
- Good: "You mentioned tracking job profitability - here's that in real-time"

**3. Pause for reactions**
- Bad: [Rapid-fire feature tour]
- Good: "How would that compare to your current process?" [Wait]

### Demo Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Instead |
|-------|---------|
| Feature dumping | Focus on 3-5 relevant capabilities |
| Talking over clicks | Narrate: "Watch what happens when I..." |
| Ignoring questions | "Great question - let me show you" |
| Generic demo | Personalize: use their company name, data |
| No discovery recap | Always start with what you learned |
| Running long | Respect the clock, leave time for Q&A |

## Objection Handling

### The LAER Framework

```
L - Listen (fully, don't interrupt)
A - Acknowledge (validate the concern)
E - Explore (understand the root)
R - Respond (address specifically)
```

### Common Objections & Responses

**Price: "It's too expensive"**
```
Acknowledge: "Budget is always a consideration."
Explore: "Help me understand - too expensive compared to what?"
Respond: "Let's look at the cost of [current problem] vs. this investment..."

Alternative angles:
- "What's the cost of NOT solving this?"
- "If we could show [X] ROI, would it still feel expensive?"
- "What budget range were you expecting?"
```

**Timing: "We're not ready right now"**
```
Acknowledge: "Timing is important."
Explore: "What would need to change for this to be the right time?"
Respond: "Many customers started [small/pilot] and expanded..."

Alternative angles:
- "When would be better? What triggers that?"
- "What's the cost of waiting another [quarter/year]?"
- "What if we started smaller - just [one team/one use case]?"
```

**Competitor: "We're also looking at [Competitor]"**
```
Acknowledge: "They're a solid company."
Explore: "What's drawing you to them?"
Respond: "Where we differ is [specific differentiator]..."

Alternative angles:
- "What criteria are you using to compare?"
- "Have you talked to their customers? Happy to share references."
- Avoid trash-talking; focus on YOUR strengths
```

**Authority: "I need to check with my boss"**
```
Acknowledge: "Of course, this is a team decision."
Explore: "What will they want to know?"
Respond: "Would it help if I joined that conversation?"

Alternative angles:
- "Can I send you materials to share with them?"
- "What's their biggest concern likely to be?"
- "Should we schedule a follow-up that includes them?"
```

**Status Quo: "What we have works fine"**
```
Acknowledge: "If it's working, that's great."
Explore: "What made you take this call in the first place?"
Respond: "Most people I talk to have something that works... until [growth/scale/problem]."

Alternative angles:
- "What would have to break for you to look for a change?"
- "Where do you see the biggest risk with current approach?"
```
