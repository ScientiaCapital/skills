    "transcript": "Just got off a great call with Mike Thompson at Reliable Mechanical. They're a 35-person commercial HVAC shop in Phoenix, been running ServiceTitan for two years now. Mike said the pricing has gotten insane, like they're paying almost three times what they started at. Really interested in our job costing, said that's the biggest gap they have right now. They're also frustrated that their techs don't use the mobile app because it's too complicated. Mike said quote 'my guys just want to clock in and see their jobs, not navigate a spaceship.' Wants to do a demo next Tuesday, bringing his ops manager.",

They're literally running everything on paper and QuickBooks, like literally paper work orders. Dave knows they need to modernize but said his techs are older and he's worried about adoption. Mentioned they looked at Housecall Pro last year but never pulled the trigger. No real urgency, said maybe they'll think about it after their busy season. I'll check back in Q1.",

About 45 people between the two divisions, mix of commercial and residential work in Atlanta. They tried Jobber maybe two years ago, total disaster, half the team refused to use it and they eventually gave up. So now they're gun shy. Sarah said she can't afford another failed implementation. But she also said inventory tracking is killing them, like they have no idea what's on the trucks. Marcus mentioned they're losing maybe 50K a year in parts they can't account for. That got their attention when I mentioned our inventory module. They want to see specifically how that works. Sarah asked about implementation support, like hand holding through the transition.

Talked to their CFO Jennifer and the operations director Tom. They're on Sage for accounting and some custom Access database thing for service that Tom built himself years ago. Jennifer is the driver here, she's frustrated because she can't get real job costing numbers out of their current setup. She said and I quote 'I'm basically guessing on every bid because I don't know our true costs.' Tom seemed a bit defensive about his system but even he admitted it's falling apart. They have a service side doing maybe 40% of revenue that's basically untracked. Jennifer asked about our reporting and I showed her a few screenshots, she got really excited. They want a full demo with their whole leadership team, like 6 people. Trying to get it scheduled for the week after next. This could be a big one, probably 50-60 licenses.",

Really interesting setup - they're 100% commercial sprinkler systems, new construction and inspection services. About 30 people, maybe 20 in the field. Currently doing everything in Excel and paper inspection forms. Carlos has been in business 30 years and never used software beyond QuickBooks. But Maria is pushing hard to modernize, she showed me their paper filing system and it's like, boxes and boxes of inspection reports. They have compliance issues because they can't find documentation when they need it. The AHJ almost dinged them on a project last month because they couldn't produce the right paperwork. Maria said 'dad we almost lost our license over this.' Carlos finally agreed they need something. Main thing they need is inspection tracking with photo documentation and being able to pull up history instantly. Also interested in scheduling for their inspection routes. Maria is the champion here, Carlos will sign off if she's happy. Doing a demo focused on inspections next Thursday.",

They're part of a bigger company, like 200 people total but Steve's division is about 40. Running FieldEdge right now and honestly seemed pretty satisfied. Main thing he wanted to know was whether we integrate with their parent company's ERP which is SAP. Told him we have an API but not a native SAP connector. He said that's probably a dealbreaker because their corporate is pushing everyone onto the same systems. Said he'd pass my info along but didn't sound optimistic.

They've been on Service Fusion for three years and are completely fed up. Rachel listed like ten things wrong with it. The dispatching is clunky, Kevin said he spends half his day fighting the software instead of actually dispatching. Techs hate the app. Reports are useless. And get this, they had a data issue last year where Service Fusion lost a bunch of their customer history and it took months to sort out. Rachel said they've already budgeted to switch this year, they just need to find the right solution. She's looked at ServiceTitan but thinks it's overkill for their size. When I walked through our dispatch board Kevin literally said 'oh my god that's so much better.' They want to do a deep dive demo with the whole office team, maybe 8 people. Shooting for early next month. Rachel asked for references from similar sized companies, I'm pulling those together. This one feels really solid, probably close it in 60 days.",

Using Outlook calendars and texts to dispatch, QuickBooks for invoicing. David said they're growing fast, like 40% last year, and the chaos is getting out of control. The IT guy was really interested in our API because they want to eventually connect our system with their BAS platform to auto-generate service tickets when a building system throws an alert. That's a cool use case actually. They need something pretty quick, David said they're hiring 5 more techs next quarter and can't scale with their current process.
