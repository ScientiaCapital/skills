<objective>
Comprehensive B2B go-to-market framework covering ICP development (firmographics, technographics, psychographics), positioning (April Dunford canvas), pricing strategy (value-based, tiered, feature gating), and opportunity evaluation (scoring, red flags, complexity levels).
</objective>

<quick_start>
**ICP scoring:** 80+ = Ideal | 60-79 = Good | 40-59 = Marginal | <40 = Pass

**Positioning statement:**
```
For [target] who [need], [product] is a [category] that [benefit].
Unlike [alternative], our product [differentiator].
```

**Value-based pricing:** Price at 10-20% of quantified value delivered

**Opportunity score:** /100 across Market Fit, Technical Fit, GTM Fit, Personal Fit, Economics
</quick_start>

<success_criteria>
GTM strategy is successful when:
- ICP documented with scoring criteria (firmographics, technographics, psychographics)
- Positioning statement follows April Dunford framework
- Pricing anchored to quantified value (not cost-plus)
- Tier structure follows Good/Better/Best with clear feature gates
- Opportunity scoring identifies red flags and good signals
- Battle cards created for top 3 competitors
- Launch checklist completed (pre-launch, launch, post-launch)
</success_criteria>

<core_content>
Comprehensive guide for B2B go-to-market strategy, pricing, and opportunity evaluation.

## Quick Reference

| Framework | Purpose | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| ICP Development | Define ideal customer | Before any outreach |
| Positioning | Differentiate in market | Product launch, pivot |
| Messaging Hierarchy | Consistent communication | Sales enablement |
| Competitive Intel | Understand landscape | Deal strategy, positioning |
| Value-Based Pricing | Price by value delivered | Setting initial prices |
| Tier Structure | Package offering | Feature gating decisions |
| Opportunity Scoring | Evaluate fit | New client/project decisions |

## Part 1: Go-To-Market Strategy

| Component | Key Output | Quick Reference |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| ICP Development | Scored profile (firmographics + technographics + psychographics) | 80+ Ideal, 60-79 Good, 40-59 Marginal, <40 Pass |
| Positioning | April Dunford canvas → positioning statement | "For [target] who [need], [product] is a [category] that [benefit]" |
| Messaging | 3-level hierarchy: Strategic → Solution → Persona | 3 max differentiators per level |
| Competitive Intel | Battle cards per competitor | Strengths, weaknesses, objection handling, win strategy |
| Channel Strategy | GTM motion selection | PLG / Sales-Assisted / Enterprise / Partner |
| Launch Playbook | Pre-launch → Launch → Post-launch checklists | T-30 / T-0 / T+30 milestones |

See `reference/gtm.md` for ICP templates, positioning canvas, battle card structure, channel strategy details, and launch checklists.

## Part 2: Pricing Strategy

| Model | Best For | Key Principle |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Flat rate | Simple products | Low complexity |
| Per seat | Team tools | Scales with usage |
| Usage-based | APIs, infra | Pay-as-you-go |
| Tiered (Good/Better/Best) | Feature differentiation | Anchor to middle tier |
| Hybrid | Enterprise SaaS | Combine seat + usage |

**Value-based pricing formula:** Price at 10-20% of quantified value delivered (time savings + revenue impact + cost avoidance).

**Feature gating:** Gate by scale (users, API calls), sophistication (advanced features), or control (SSO, audit logs). Never gate security or data export.

**Discounting:** Volume (10-30%), term (15-25%), competitive (20-40%), strategic (up to 50%). Alternatives: extended terms, training, milestone unlocks.

See `reference/pricing.md` for value calculation templates, tier structure frameworks, pricing psychology tactics, and discounting strategy.

## Part 3: Opportunity Evaluation

**Quick score:** /100 across Market Fit (25), Technical Fit (20), GTM Fit (20), Personal Fit (20), Economics (15).

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 80-100 | **STRONG PURSUE** — Prioritize |
| 60-79 | **EXPLORE** — Worth time investment |
| 40-59 | **CONDITIONAL** — Only if specific factor changes |
| 0-39 | **PASS** — Opportunity cost too high |

**Red flags:** Unclear payment, expanding scope pre-start, pressure to decide fast, misaligned incentives, economics don't work even optimistically.

**GTM complexity:** PLG (<$2K, days) → Low-Touch ($2-15K, weeks) → Mid-Market ($15-100K, months) → Enterprise ($100K+, 6-18mo).

See `reference/opportunity.md` for evaluation templates (projects, clients, partnerships), detailed scoring, unit economics, and complexity levels.
