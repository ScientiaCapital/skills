# MEP+E Contractor ICP - Coperniq

## Ideal Customer Profile

### The Sweet Spot

**Revenue:** $5M - $50M annually

**Why this range:**
- < $5M: Too small, Jobber/Housecall Pro works fine
- $5-50M: "No man's land" - too complex for SMB tools, too small for ServiceTitan
- > $50M: ServiceTitan, Procore ecosystem makes sense

**Trades:** Multi-trade operations (2+ of these)
- Electrical (commercial/residential)
- HVAC
- Plumbing
- Low voltage / Fire alarm
- Solar / Battery

**Why multi-trade matters:**
- Single-trade shops can use vertical-specific tools
- Multi-trade = integration nightmare = our opportunity
