Mastering discovery calls and product demonstrations for B2B sales.

## Quick Reference

| Stage | Goal | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| Opening | Build rapport, set agenda | 2-3 min |
| Discovery | Uncover pain, qualify | 15-20 min |
| Demo | Show relevant value | 15-20 min |
| Close | Agree next steps | 5 min |

## Discovery Framework

### The Discovery Mindset

```
Discovery is NOT about:          Discovery IS about:
❌ Pitching your product         ✓ Understanding their world
❌ Checking boxes                ✓ Genuine curiosity
❌ Interrogating                 ✓ Conversational flow
❌ Assuming pain                 ✓ Letting them articulate pain
```

### SPIN Questioning Technique

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **S**ituation | Understand context | "Walk me through your current process..." |
| **P**roblem | Surface pain | "What challenges do you face with...?" |
| **I**mplication | Deepen pain | "What happens when that goes wrong?" |
| **N**eed-Payoff | Envision solution | "If you could fix that, what would change?" |

### Discovery Question Bank

**Opening / Rapport**
```
- "Before we dive in, what prompted you to take this call today?"
- "What's the most important thing you want to get out of our time?"
- "I've done some research, but I'd love to hear it from you - what does [Company] do?"
```

**Current State**
```
- "Walk me through how your team handles [process] today."
- "What tools are you currently using for [function]?"
- "How many people are involved in [workflow]?"
- "What does a typical [day/week/project] look like?"
```

**Pain Discovery**
```
- "What's working well with your current approach?"
- "Where does the process break down?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would you change?"
- "What's the biggest headache in [area]?"
- "When was the last time [problem] cost you [time/money/deal]?"
```

**Impact / Implication**
```
- "What happens when [problem] occurs?"
- "How does that affect [team/revenue/customers]?"
- "What does that cost you in terms of [time/money/opportunity]?"
- "How long has this been an issue?"
- "What have you tried to fix it?"
```

**Decision Process**
```
- "Who else is involved in evaluating solutions like this?"
- "What does your decision process typically look like?"
- "What's driving the timeline to make a change?"
- "What would make this a 'no' for you?"
- "Have you looked at other solutions?"
```

## MEDDIC Qualification

### Framework Overview

| Letter | Element | Question to Answer |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **M** | Metrics | What's the measurable impact? |
| **E** | Economic Buyer | Who controls the budget? |
| **D** | Decision Criteria | How will they decide? |
| **D** | Decision Process | What are the steps to buy? |
| **I** | Identify Pain | What's the compelling reason to act? |
| **C** | Champion | Who's selling internally for us? |

### MEDDIC Deep Dive Questions

**Metrics**
```
- "What does success look like in numbers?"
- "How are you measuring [current process] today?"

```

**Economic Buyer**
```
- "Who ultimately signs off on purchases like this?"
- "Is there a budget allocated for this initiative?"
- "Who else needs to approve?"
- "Have you worked with [economic buyer] on similar projects?"
```

**Decision Criteria**
```
- "What criteria will you use to evaluate solutions?"
- "What's most important: price, features, support, or something else?"
- "Are there any must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?"
- "What would disqualify a vendor?"
```

**Decision Process**
```
- "Walk me through how decisions like this typically get made."
- "What are the steps between now and going live?"
- "Are there any procurement or legal reviews required?"
- "What's a realistic timeline?"
```

- "Is this a top-3 priority for the team/company?"
- "What's changed that made this a priority?"
```

**Champion**
```
- "Who on your team is most excited about solving this?"
- "Have you championed a purchase like this before?"
- "What would make you look good internally?"
- "How can I help you build the case?"
```

## Demo Best Practices

### Demo Structure

```
1. RECAP (2 min)
   └── "Based on our discovery, you mentioned [pain 1], [pain 2], [pain 3]..."

2. AGENDA (1 min)
   └── "I'll show you how we address each of those. Stop me anytime."

3. SHOW VALUE (15-20 min)
   └── Pain 1 → Feature → Benefit → Proof
   └── Pain 2 → Feature → Benefit → Proof
   └── Pain 3 → Feature → Benefit → Proof

4. SUMMARIZE (2 min)
   └── "So to recap, you'd be able to [benefit 1], [benefit 2], [benefit 3]..."

5. NEXT STEPS (5 min)
   └── "What questions do you have? What's our next step?"
```

### Demo Principles

```markdown
## The 3 Rules of Demos

1. **Show, don't tell**
   Bad: "We have great reporting"
   Good: [Open report] "Here's what your Monday morning would look like"

2. **Connect every feature to their pain**
   Bad: "Here's our dashboard with 50 widgets"
   Good: "You mentioned tracking job profitability - here's that in real-time"

3. **Pause for reactions**
   Bad: [Rapid-fire feature tour]
   Good: "How would that compare to your current process?" [Wait]
```

### Demo Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Instead |
|-------|---------|
| Feature dumping | Focus on 3-5 relevant capabilities |
| Talking over clicks | Narrate: "Watch what happens when I..." |
| Ignoring questions | "Great question - let me show you" |
| Generic demo | Personalize: use their company name, data |
| No discovery recap | Always start with what you learned |

## Objection Handling

### The LAER Framework

```
L - Listen (fully, don't interrupt)
A - Acknowledge (validate the concern)
E - Explore (understand the root)
R - Respond (address specifically)
```

### Common Objections

**Price Objections**
```
"It's too expensive"
→ Acknowledge: "Budget is always a consideration."
→ Explore: "Help me understand - too expensive compared to what?"
→ Respond: "Let's look at the cost of [current problem] vs. investment..."
```

**Timing Objections**
```
"We're not ready right now"
→ Acknowledge: "Timing is important."
→ Explore: "What would need to change for this to be the right time?"
→ Respond: "Many customers started [small/pilot] and expanded..."
```

**Competitor Objections**
```
"We're also looking at [Competitor]"
→ Acknowledge: "They're a solid company."
→ Explore: "What's drawing you to them?"
→ Respond: "Where we differ is [specific differentiator]..."
```

**Authority Objections**
```
"I need to check with my boss"
→ Acknowledge: "Of course, this is a team decision."
→ Explore: "What will they want to know?"
→ Respond: "Would it help if I joined that conversation?"
```
